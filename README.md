# Continuum Documentation

## Overview

Continuum is an AI-powered project management web application designed to maintain context and project awareness across different interaction sessions, thread windows, and users. It serves as a central knowledge repository that preserves context between AI assistant sessions, standardizes communication, centralizes project knowledge, and facilitates collaboration.

## Core Purpose

The primary purpose of Continuum is to maintain context between different AI assistant interactions. When working with AI assistants across multiple chat sessions or with different team members, context can easily be lost. Continuum solves this problem by:

1. **Preserving Context Between Sessions**: Ensures AI assistants can maintain awareness of project status, history, and requirements across multiple conversations
2. **Standardizing Communication**: Provides a consistent framework for interacting with AI assistants about project details
3. **Centralizing Project Knowledge**: Creates a single source of truth for project information that persists beyond individual chat sessions
4. **Facilitating Collaboration**: Allows multiple users to work with AI assistants on the same project with consistent context

## Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for Continuum:

- [Continuum User Manual](continuum-user-manual.md) - Complete guide for using Continuum with AI assistants
- [Technical Setup Guide](continuum-technical-setup.md) - Instructions for setting up and configuring Continuum

## Using Continuum with AI Assistants

To use Continuum effectively with AI assistants:

1. **Start each session** with the phrase: "Follow the Continuum User Manual"
2. **Authenticate** with Continuum using admin credentials
3. **Reference specific projects, tasks, or documents** using their UIDs or full titles
4. **Use consistent command patterns** for viewing, creating, updating, and deleting resources

By referencing the Continuum User Manual at the beginning of each session with an AI assistant, you establish the necessary context for the AI to understand the current state of your project and continue work seamlessly from previous sessions.

## Key Features

Continuum includes the following core features:

1. **Project Tracking**: Create and manage projects, tasks, and subtasks
2. **Documentation Hub**: Centralized repository for project documentation with rich formatting
3. **AI Integration**: AI-powered features for documentation generation and project insights
4. **Multi-User Functionality**: Support for multiple users with different roles and permissions
5. **Operational Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for using and maintaining the system

## Project Status

Continuum is approximately 80-85% complete, with implemented features including project tracking, documentation hub, basic AI integration, and multi-user functionality.
